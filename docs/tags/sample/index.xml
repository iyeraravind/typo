      <description>Drafts are a work in progress.  Drafts are posts that are not yet ready to be published. Jekyll has built-in support for drafts. This is how it works.
Create a _drafts folder at your site&amp;rsquo;s root, create a new post in that folder, and run jekyll serve with the --drafts switch. Your draft turns up at the top of your recent posts (or wherever you have set up new posts to appear on your site).</description>

      <description>How I discovered the Mahavishnu Orchestra   Listening to Mahavishnu Orchestra for the first time, while reading the liner notes! (artwork courtesy of Aravind Iyer) Pro-Tip: Click the play button  above, choose your streaming service, and listen while you read!  It is generally agreed that experiences are more valuable to people than possessions1. From that perspective, a musical performance is something unique and wonderful. Attending one can be an experience to remember, and yet it can be bottled into a record which a music lover can possess and use to re-live the experience.</description>
