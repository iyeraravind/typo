      <description>Drafts are a work in progress.  Drafts are posts that are not yet ready to be published. Jekyll has built-in support for drafts. This is how it works.
Create a _drafts folder at your site&amp;rsquo;s root, create a new post in that folder, and run jekyll serve with the --drafts switch. Your draft turns up at the top of your recent posts (or wherever you have set up new posts to appear on your site).</description>
